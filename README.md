Welcome to my GitHub repository! My name's Tom, and I currently work as a data consultant at the Information Lab UK, where I specialise in Tableau and Alteryx. I hold a First-Class Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Newcastle University, where I developed a strong foundation in software engineering principles and problem-solving skills. 

This repository is a collection of my projects, experiments, and contributions to various open-source initiatives. Feel free to explore, collaborate, and provide feedback!
